### Manual

# Usage

1. Upload some images to your `/media/photo-frame-images` folder
2. Add PhotoFrame card to your dashboard
3. If you followed the Home Assistant Configuration above, the default sensor name should match and the card should already display your images

# Troubleshooting

## Optimize images
When uploading from iOS Home Assistant Companion App, you can use the iOS built-in resize option in the Photo picker to let iOS resize images (e.g. to "Large" is suitable for most cases) before uploading them to Home Assistant:

## Errors
- Resolving web url path for: media-source://media_source/media/photo-frame-images/IMG_1234.heic
  - `{code: "resolve_media_failed", message: "Unknown source directory."}`
    - Check your `media_dirs` configuration and make sure that `media: /media` is present
